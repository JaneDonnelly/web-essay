    <h2>Was Saul Bass successful in making the 'Ordinary Extraordinary'</h2>
    <a id="intro"></a>
<h3> Introduction </h3> </a>
<p>In the world of design, it is often difficult to do anything that is considered innovative, revolutionary and ground-breaking. The desire to be original, one-of-a-kind and unique is pursued by many a designer and is often never achieved. Saul Bass is one of the very few that managed to achieve the theoretically unachievable. He created numerous logos for companies such as Kleenex, AT&T Corporation and Quaker Oats. Most of these logos have stood the test of time having been created in the 1960-80s and are still around today showing Bass had the skills to create timeless designs. However, it was not his branding work that thoroughly thrusted Bass into the spotlight. It was his radical work on film title sequences that gave him the name he has in the design community today. He single-handily changed how title sequences were to be viewed forever, a considerable feat for one designer.  </p>

<blockquote>“In these titles I came to grips with what I think is the most challenging aspect of any creative endeavour and that is deal with ordinary things, things that we see so well that we cease to see them, deal with them in way that lets us understand them again, in a sense making the ordinary extraordinary” – Saul Bass</blockquote>

<p>Bass was a 20th Century American graphic design and Oscar-winning filmmaker. Considered by some to be the most accomplished graphic designer in history. In 1920, Bass was born in Bronx, New York City, the second child to his parents, Aaron and Pauline, who were Eastern European Jewish immigrants. His creative abilities were evident from a young age in his love for drawing. Bass states his “earliest memory of artwork was my father giving me a Crayola box...drew until I’d worn the down…he gave me another box and I kept going.”  (Bass, Kirkham and Bass, 2011). His education began at James Monroe High School. He showed potential from the outset. In 1936, a scout discovered Bass after seeing his work in a shopfront and inquiring after the creator of said work. This lead to him receiving a fellowship to the Art Students League in Manhattan. A Following this he continued to peruse his studies at Brooklyn College where he attended night classes. His tutor was Hungarian designer György Kepes, a master of Bauhaus design. Kepes helped to “transform the ways in which Saul thought about design, helping him make the transition from a talented designer with a burgeoning interest in Modernist graphics to a major player.”  (Bass, Kirkham and Bass, 2011) In the 1940s, Bass left New York City for Los Angeles, California. He worked mostly for advertising firms in addition to designing iconic film logos and posters. In 1954, Otto Preminger, a filmmaker, gave Bass the opportunity to design a poster for his upcoming film Carmen Jones. It was this job offer that would set the wheels of change into motion. While working on the design for Carmen Jones, Bass states he turned to Otto and said, “why don’t we make it move?”. (Saul Bass: The Name Behind the Titles., 2018)  The rest is history. Carmen Jones was the first of many films with a title sequences designed by Saul Bass. It’s also important to note that Saul Bass’ creative abilities didn’t end at title sequences. He and his wife Elaine created numerous short films together. He also designed record covers, illustrated a children’s book (Henry’s Walk to Paris, 1962), worked on covers for John Entenza’s Arts& Architecture magazine and collaborated with architects Buff, Straub & Hensman on the design of his house.

<p>Before Bass, the opening credits of a film were nothing out of the ordinary. In fact, they simply consisted of the studio logo and a sequence of title cards. Its only purpose was to inform. They were consistent, rarely changing from film to film. Bass changed all of this. He saw potential in something no one else ever had before. He took a thing that was dull and uninteresting and turned it into a piece of art. He “elevated the opening of Hollywood films to the status of art form.”  (Bass, Kirkham and Bass, 2011) Title sequences where no longer a monotonous interlude before the movie began. Bass believed audience involvement with the film should begin with the very first frame. Steven Spielberg stated, “Saul Bass wasn’t just an artist who contributed to the first several minutes of some of the greatest movies in history, in my opinion his body of work qualifies him as one of the best filmmakers of this, or any time.”  (Bass, Kirkham and Bass, 2011) Such high praise coming from such an esteemed film director shows that extent of Bass’ talent and skill. Bass described the main purpose of title sequences as “setting mood, creating an atmosphere, an attitude and a generalised metaphor for what the film was about.”  (Bass, Kirkham and Bass, 2011) An example of this would be his title sequence he created in 1960 for Alfred Hitchcock for his movie Psycho. His use of graphics, sound and text created an atmosphere of foreboding. He used his graphics to prepare the audience for the emotions they were going to experience.
Bass had an opportunity to create titles and poster for Otto Preminger ‘s film “The Man with the Golden Arm” created in 1955. This was one of his first masterpieces. Preminger’s decision to adapt a book about drug addiction into a film was a taboo topic at the time, therefor Bass has to maintain a level of sensitivity when creating his design. The final outcome was simplistically created, an abstract creation of an arm. The shape of the arm is jagged and disjointed which Bass want to do to portray the jarring disjointed existence of a drug addict. The title sequence was also very simplistic with four white bars that form into an arm with a monochromatic colour scheme to keep in tune with the sombre theme. Despite the simplistic animation Bass is still capable to create the desired emotional effect.  “Around the World in Eight Days” is another piece of impressive work by Bass. The opening sequence for this 1956 Oscar- winning film was the longest and most expensive ever produced at this point. It cost roughly 65,000 dollars. It is considered to be in equivalence with the movie itself. The 6-minute animated title sequences takes you through the highlights of the film, introducing the cast and all who were involved in creating the film. I enjoyed this title sequence. It was full of wit, humour and clever transitions. Not only was Bass’ work innovative, it was also incredibly well done. Bass would use this style again for “It’s a Mad Mad Mad World” for Stanley Kramer in 1963. He creates numerous different scenes using a “globe”. He really focuses on creative ways to display credits in this title sequence. Bass’ creativity is increasing evident through-out his title sequence career. In the opening credits of Walk on the Wild Side Bass used only cats to recreate key scenes from the move itself.

<p>Bass didn’t just help to revolutionise the film industry. His work inspired others. Martin Scorsese is someone who is very vocal about the influence Saul Bass had on him. Scorsese was a filmmaker/actor who was commonly known in the Hollywood community. He is considered on be one of the most influential filmmakers of his time. Bass hadn’t created any new title work for nearly a decade. In 1990, he asked Bass to help him work on his film Goodfellas. The decision to ask Bass to work him was one that caused Scorsese to question if he was even worthy of such an opportunity. This awe for Bass showed just how respected he was in the design community. Bass agreed to work with him, and was this followed up with three more projects, Cape Fear, The Age of Innocence and Casino. In an interview in 2011 Scorsese praised Bass highly stating, “Before I ever met him, before we worked together, he was a legend in my eyes. His designs, for film titles and company logos and record albums and posters, defined an era. In essence, they found and distilled the poetry. Of the modern, industrialised world”.  (Bass, Kirkham and Bass, 2011) He also commented on the fact that “when we were growing up and seeing movies, we came to recognise Saul’s designs…they made the picture instantly special.” (Bass, Kirkham and Bass, 2011)

<h3 <a id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3> </a>
<p>Bass’ work can still be seen in the world today, evident from the opening credits of movies such as Catch Me if You Can. The animated, story-telling style of its opening sequence is very clearly inspired by Bass. The span of his influence is quite extraordinary and, in a sense, he is the influence behind every title sequence. “His titles were integral to the film as a whole, when his work comes up on the screen, the movie itself truly begins He used his design skills to create an atmosphere for the film before it began”. (Meggs, 1998) It is fair to say that Bass was successful in making the “ordinary, extraordinary.”</p>
